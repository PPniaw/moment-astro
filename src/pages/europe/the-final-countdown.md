<LyricSection>

We&rsquo;re leaving together, but still it&rsquo;s farewell

And maybe we&rsquo;ll come back

To Earth, who can tell?

I guess there is no one to blame

We&rsquo;re leaving ground (Leaving ground)

Will things ever be the same again?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s the final countdown

The final countdown

oh...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We&rsquo;re heading for Venus (Venus)

And still we stand tall

Cause maybe they&rsquo;ve seen us

And welcome us all, yeah

With so many lightyears to go

And things to be found (to be found)

I&rsquo;m sure that we&rsquo;ll all miss her so

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s the final countdown

The final countdown

The final countdown (final countdown)

oh...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

The final countdown

Oh, it&rsquo;s the final countdown

The final countdown

The final countdown (final countdown)

Oh, it&rsquo;s the final countdown

We&rsquo;re leaving together (the final countdown)

We&rsquo;ll all miss her so

It&rsquo;s the final countdown (final countdown)

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Oh, it&rsquo;s the final countdown

Yeah
