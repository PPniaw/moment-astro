<LyricSection>

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

And I have been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

Can you feel it coming in the air tonight?

Oh lord, oh lord

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Well, if you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand

I have seen your face before, my friend, but I don&rsquo;t know if you know who I am

Well, I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes

So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you have been

It&rsquo;s all been a pack of lies

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

I have been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

I have been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I remember, I remember, don&rsquo;t worry, how could I ever forget?

It&rsquo;s the first time, the last time we ever met

But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, no, you don&rsquo;t fool me

The hurt doesn&rsquo;t show, but the pain still grows

It&rsquo;s no stranger to you and me

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

I have been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord

I have been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord

And I have been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord

I have been waiting for this moment all my life, oh lord, oh lord

I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord

I have been waiting for this moment all my life, oh lord, oh lord
