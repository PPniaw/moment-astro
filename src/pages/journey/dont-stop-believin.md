<LyricSection>

Just a small town girl

Living in a lonely world

She took the midnight train going anywhere

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Just a city boy

Born and raised in south Detroit

He took the midnight train going anywhere

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

A singer in a smoky room

A smell of wine and cheap perfume

For a smile they can share the night

It goes on and on, and on, and on

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Strangers waiting

Up and down the boulevard

Their shadows searching in the night

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Streetlights, people

Living just to find emotion

Hiding somewhere in the night

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Working hard to get my fill

Everybody wants a thrill

Paying anything to roll the dice

Just one more time

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Some will win, some will lose

Some were born to sing the blue

Oh, the movie never ends

It goes on and on, and on, and on

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Strangers waiting

Up and down the boulevard

Their shadows searching in the night

Streetlight people

Living just to find emotion

Hiding somewhere in the night

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Don&rsquo;t stop believin&rsquo;

Hold on to that feeling

Streetlight people

Don&rsquo;t stop believin&rsquo;

Hold on...

Streetlight people

Don&rsquo;t stop believin&rsquo;

Hold on to that feeling

Streetlight people
