<LyricSection>

Pressure, pushing down on me

Pressing down on you, no men ask for

Under pressure that burns a building down

Splits a family in two

Puts people on streets

That&rsquo;s OK

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s the terror of knowing what this world is about

Watching some good friends screaming:

&ldquo;Let me out!&rdquo;

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Tomorrow gets me higher

Pressure on people, people on streets

OK

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor

These are the days

It never rains but it pours

People on streets, people on streets

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

It&rsquo;s the terror of knowing what this world is about

Watching some good friends screaming

&ldquo;Let me out!&rdquo;

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high

Pressure on people, people on streets

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Turned away from it all like a blind man

Sat on a fence, but it doesn&rsquo;t work

Keep coming up with love, but it&rsquo;s so slashed and torn

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Why, why, why?

Love, love, love...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Insanity laughs under pressure

We&rsquo;re breaking

Can&rsquo;t we give ourselves one more chance?

Why can&rsquo;t we give love that one more chance?

Why can&rsquo;t we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Because love is such an old-fashioned word

And love dares you to care for the people on the edge of the night

And love dares you to change our way of caring about ourselves

This is our last dance

This is our last dance

This is ourselves

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Under pressure

Under pressure

Pressure
