<LyricSection>

Ground Control to Major Tom

Ground Control to Major Tom

Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ground Control to Major Tom

Commencing countdown, engines on

Check ignition

And may God&rsquo;s love be with you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Liftoff

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

This is Ground Control to Major Tom

You&rsquo;ve really made the grade

And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear

Now it&rsquo;s time to leave the capsule if you dare

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

This is Major Tom to Ground Control

I&rsquo;m stepping through the door

And I&rsquo;m floating in a most peculiar way

And the stars look very different today

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

For here

Am I sitting in a tin can

Far above the world

Planet Earth is blue

And there&rsquo;s nothing I can do

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Though I&rsquo;m past one hundred thousand miles

I&rsquo;m feeling very still

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go

Tell my wife I love her very much

She knows

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Ground Control to Major Tom

Your circuit&rsquo;s dead

There&rsquo;s something wrong

Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Can you hear me, Major Tom?

Can you...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Here am I floating round my tin can

Far above the Moon

Planet Earth is blue

And there&rsquo;s nothing I can do

</LyricSection>
