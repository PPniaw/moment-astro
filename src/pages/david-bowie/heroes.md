<LyricSection>

I, I will be king

And you, you will be queen

Though nothing will drive them away

We can beat them, just for one day

We can be Heroes, just for one day

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

And you, you can be mean

And I, I&rsquo;ll drink all the time

&rsquo;Cause we&rsquo;re lovers, and that is a fact

Yes, we&rsquo;re lovers, and that is that

Though nothing will keep us together

We could steal time, just for one day

We can be Heroes, for ever and ever

What would you say?

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I, I wish you could swim

Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

Though nothing, nothing will keep us together

We can beat them, for ever and ever

Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I, I will be king

And you, you will be queen

Though nothing will drive them away

We can be Heroes, just for one day

We can be us, just for one day

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I, I can remember (I remember)

Standing by the wall (by the wall)

And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)

And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)

And the shame was on the other side

Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever

Then we could be Heroes, just for one day

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We can be Heroes

We can be Heroes

We can be Heroes

Just for one day

We can be Heroes

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We are nothing, and nothing will help us

Maybe we&rsquo;re lying, then you better not stay

But we could be safer, just for one day

Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh

Just for one day

</LyricSection>
