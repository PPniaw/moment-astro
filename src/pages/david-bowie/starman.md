<LyricSection>

Hey now, now

Oh...

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Didn&rsquo;t know what time it was

The lights were low

I leaned back on my radio

Some cat was laying down some rock and roll

&ldquo;Lotta soul,&rdquo; he said

Then the loud sound did seem to fade

Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase

That weren&rsquo;t no DJ

that was hazy cosmic jive

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

There&rsquo;s a starman waiting in the sky

He&rsquo;d like to come and meet us

But he thinks he&rsquo;d blow our minds

There&rsquo;s a starman waiting in the sky

He&rsquo;s told us not to blow it

&rsquo;Cause he knows it&rsquo;s all worthwhile

He told me

Let the children lose it

Let the children use it

Let all the children boogie

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

I had to phone someone so I picked on you

Hey, that&rsquo;s far out, so you heard him too

Switch on the TV

We may pick him up on channel two

Look out your window, I can see his light

If we can sparkle he may land tonight

Don&rsquo;t tell your poppa or he&rsquo;ll get us locked up in fright

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

There&rsquo;s a starman waiting in the sky

He&rsquo;d like to come and meet us

But he thinks he&rsquo;d blow our minds

There&rsquo;s a starman waiting in the sky

He&rsquo;s told us not to blow it

&rsquo;Cause he knows it&rsquo;s all worthwhile

He told me

Let the children lose it

Let the children use it

Let all the children boogie
