<LyricSection>

We're not gonna take it

No! we ain't gonna take it

We're not gonna take it anymore

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We've got the right to choose it

There ain't no way we will lose it

This is our life

This is our song

We will fight the powers that be just

Don't pick our destiny cause

You don't know us

You don't belong

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We're not gonna take it

No! we ain't gonna take it

We're not gonna take it anymore

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Oh! you're so condescending

Your gall is never ending

We don't want nothing, not a thing from you

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Your life is trite and jaded

Boring and confiscated

If that's your best, your best won't do

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Wo-oh-oh

Wo-oh-oh

We're right! Yeah!

We're free! Yeah!

We'll fight! Yeah!

You'll see! Yeah!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Oh, we're not gonna take it

No, we ain't gonna take it

Oh, we're not gonna take it anymore...

No way!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

Wo-oh-oh

Wo-oh-oh

We're right! Yeah!

We're free! Yeah!

We'll fight! Yeah!

You'll see! Yeah!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We're not gonna take it

No! we ain't gonna take it

We're not gonna take it anymore

We're not gonna take it

No!

No! we ain't gonna take it

We're not gonna take it anymore

Just you try and make us!

</LyricSection>

<LyricSection>

We're not gonna take it

Come on!

No! we ain't gonna take it

You're all worthless and weak!

We're not gonna take it anymore

Now drop and give me twenty!

We're not gonna take it

A pledge pin?!

No! we ain't gonna take it

On your uniform!

We're not gonna take it anymore
